- CLIP-score:
    * Implement function to wrap all logic
    * Add CLIP-score to double-sweep for "zebras" caption
- Come up with additional hyper-parameters for the pipe ("guidance" for de-noising loop?)
- Pre-process image before using it as latents for initial step

* reverse the implementation of 'postprocess' for the image before embedding it in VAE
