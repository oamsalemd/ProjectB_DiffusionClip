- CLIP-score:
    * Implement function to wrap all logic
    * Add CLIP-score to double-sweep for "zebras" caption
- Come up with additional hyper-parameters for the pipe ("guidance" for de-noising loop?)
- Pre-process image before using it as latents for initial step

1. For basic use-case - no significant difference between DDIM (linear) scheduler and defulat scheduler
2. Encoding image to latent and calling pipe for 1 inference step resulted in the same original image (fixed)
3. Timesteps spacing works well for configurable "start_alpha" (overriding DDIM "set_timesteps")
4. Results: sweeped "start_alpha": [0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3]
