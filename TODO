- CLIP-score - how to use, what to set as input (text? image?), ...
- Come up with additional hyper-parameters for the pipe ("guidance" for de-noising loop?)
- Pre-process image before using it as latents for initial step

- Status for now:
1. Double sweep: num_steps, noise_scale (for latents)
2. Low-noise latents (i.e. high-'image' latents) preserve structure but doesn't implement style transfer well
3. Low-noise and High-steps show more "sharp" images then Low-steps
